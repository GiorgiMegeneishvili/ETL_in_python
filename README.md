📚 How it works
Extract

Fetches data from a specified source (e.g. API, CSV, database)

Transform

Cleans and processes the data

Converts formats

Handles missing values

Load

Writes the transformed data to a target destination (e.g. database, CSV)

🗂️ Example Use Case
You can customize the extract, transform, and load scripts to work with:

APIs (e.g. OpenWeatherMap, World Bank)

Local CSV/Excel files

SQL Databases
